                <h3 id="1">1. Tim Tams</h3>
                <p>
                    Tim Tams are one of Australia's most iconic snacks and a must-try for any foreigner. A product of Australian biscuit company Arnott’s, the classic Tim Tam is a double-layered chocolate-malted biscuit filled with chocolate cream and coated in yet more chocolate. 
                </p>
                
                <h3 id="2">2. Fish and chips</h3>
                <p>
                    Fish and chips may be one of the national dishes of Great Britain, but it’s also a popular way to eat fish in Australia. However, while the British usually serve it with malt vinegar and a side of mushy peas, Australians typically take theirs with tartare or tomato sauce.
                </p>

                <h3 id="3">3. Berbecue</h3>
                <p>
                    Barbecue is a big part of Australian food culture, especially in the summer. Colloquially termed the “barbie,” Australian barbecue is more than just a way of cooking your food — it’s a culinary experience meant to be shared with family and friends. 
                </p>
                
                <h3 id="4">4. Fairy Bread</h3>
                <p>
                    A favorite of Australian children, fairy bread is a simple yet magical treat for all ages. It consists of sliced white bread with butter or margarine covered in rainbow nonpareil sprinkles, which Australians call “hundreds and thousands.”
                </p>
            
                <h3 id="5">5. Chery ripe</h3>
                <p>
                    The Cherry Ripe bar is Australia’s oldest chocolate bar, though it’s popular for more reasons than its history. Originally released in 1924 by MacRobertson Chocolates and later produced by Cadbury Australia, the Cherry Ripe contains sweet cherries and moist coconut wrapped in silky dark chocolate. 
                </p>

                <h3 id="6">6. Vegemite</h3>
                <p>
                    Like British marmite, vegemite is a dark brown paste made from vegetables, spices and brewer’s yeast. It has a deep umami flavor that people tend to either love or hate. 
                </p>

                <h3 id="7">7. Lamington</h3>
                <p>
                    Lamingtons are square-shaped butter or sponge cakes coated with chocolate frosting and topped with a generous sprinkle of shredded coconut. They also occasionally come with a layer of cream or jam in the middle.

                <h3 id="a1">1. Koalas</h3>
                <p>
                    The koala is an iconic Australian animal. Often called the koala “bear,” this tree-climbing animal is a marsupial—a mammal with a pouch for the development of offspring.
                </p>

                <h3 id="a2">2. Wombats</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Wombats are marsupials with brown, tan or grey fur and from their stubby tails to their large skulls they can measure 1.3m long and weigh 36kg. Often described as 'stout', 'sturdy' or 'powerful', they're expert diggers with short, muscular legs and sharp claws.
                </p>

                <h3 id="a3">3. Kangaroos</h3>
                <p>
                    Kangaroos are large marsupials that are found only in Australia. They are identified by their muscular tails, strong back legs, large feet, short fur and long, pointed ears. Like all marsupials, a sub-type of mammal, females have pouches that contain mammary glands, where their young live until they are old enough to emerge.
                </p>

                <h3 id="a4">4. platypus</h3>
                <p>
                    The platypus is among nature's most unlikely animals. In fact, the first scientists to examine a specimen believed they were the victims of a hoax. The animal is best described as a hodgepodge of more familiar species: the duck (bill and webbed feet), beaver (tail), and otter (body and fur).
                </p>

                <h3 id="a5">5. Emu</h3>
                <p>
                    The Emu is Australia's tallest native bird, reaching between 1.6 m and 1.9 m when standing erect. Adult Emus are covered with shaggy grey-brown feathers except for the neck and head, which are largely naked and bluish-black. The wings are greatly reduced, but the legs are long and powerful. 
                </p>

                <h3 id="a6">6. Tasmanian devil</h3>
                <p>
                    Having the appearance of a small dog, it is characterized by its black fur and white markings on the chest and some times rump. Their stocky nature is accentuated by their short muzzle and limbs.

                        Almost everyone speaks English and more than 15% speak languages other than English at home, so you should known or speak english if you want to be understood

                    <h3>2. Sports</h3>

                    <p>
                        Sports are a favourite pastime and a great way to socialise with friends, like cricket, golf, rugby, tennis. <br> these sports will make you sociable and frendly to the australian people, these sports are like the daily style. in fact Australia is a nation of sports lovers. Four in five (80%) Australians agree that sport is a significant part of Australian culture. We are proud that we punch above our weight on the international stage, be it the Olympics, soccer world cup, the cricket or rugby. The often-used analogy to describe our obsession with sport, is that to Australians, sport is like a religion, if you want more details about this you can visit

                    <h3>3. Clothing</h3>

                    <p>
                        There are no laws or regulations about clothing though some venues, workplaces and restaurants have dress codes. Many people will dress to suit their style, climate or situation. in my opinion if you will visit Australia, you may be headed for the beach or go on a trek to the Australian Outback. For those destinations you'll need activity-specific gear. But in the towns and cities, casual wear is generally the way to go when you're visiting Australia. And if you are a backpacker, consider changing to cleaner, nicer clothing for the city.
